# BikeShare---Chicago
# Cyclistic - Google data analyst certificate

## INTRODUCTION

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic, about a bike share in Chicago. In order to answer the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## BACKGROUND

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

## SCENARIO

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annualmembers. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### ASK

I have been working on a case study about cycling bicycles in a different way. For this step I have used Excel to analyze the data to design marketing strategies aimed at converting occasional cyclists into annual members. 
The manager has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


### PREPARE 

In this step I analyzed the data and indentify trends. 
For this project, I download the Divvy 2019 Q1 and Divvy 2020 Q1 datasets from [[divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)]

### PROCESS

I used Excel to clean the data and combined. 

### ANALYZE AND SHARE
For this step I prefered to use PowerBi to share the results of the analysis. 

First, I compare the proportion on Casual Members and Suscriber Members

The Suscribers make 91% of the total while 9% are Casual customers. There we can conclude that the most of the bike's users are Suscribers.

Next, average of ride lenght per day of week and customer.

From this chart we can conclude that casual customers tend to cycle longer than suscribers do and both have the most average at the weekend. 

Analyzing the frecuency of rides per hour:

In this graph we can see that Subscribers ride their bikes more in the early morning and then in the afternoon, perhaps because they use this transport to go to work, and Customers prefer to ride from mid-morning onwards, perhaps they are tourists and prefer to make a trip by bike. 

If we analize the rides per day of week:

We can conclude that the days of the week with more ride are from Monday to Friday. 

Finally, if we analize the ride length per fay of week and customer:

From this chart we can conclude that Customers prefer to ride more at the weekend insted of the Suscribers that prefere the day of the weeks. 

At the end, I create a dashboard where you can see all this charts:

Summary:
Casual Customers prefer to ride at weekend, from mid-morning and for more time but not so frecuently. Whereas Suscribers prefer to ride during the week, for shorts periods early in the morning and in the evening more frecuently.

### ACT

After identifying the differences between casual customers and suscribers, we can apply some strategies to target casual customers to became members:
- Casual customers use the bikes more than suscribers, the company can offer discounts if they became members.
