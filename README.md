# BikeShare---Chicago
# Cyclistic - Google data analyst certificate

## INTRODUCTION

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic, about a bike share in Chicago. In order to answer the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## BACKGROUND

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

## SCENARIO

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annualmembers. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### ASK

I have been working on a case study about cycling bicycles in a different way. For this step I have used Excel to analyze the data to design marketing strategies aimed at converting occasional cyclists into annual members. 

### PREPARE 

In this step I analyzed the data and indentify trends.
